This code contains some helper functions Callt and ArrayProban. I also added an S argument to all functions (making it easier for testing)

Plots and commentaries are in the python notebook. Test functions are in the second .py file.

'''
This function is a helper function. It returns the price of the European call for the underlying asset, with Strike K and price at 0 S, at time t.

This is based on a time shift argument:
As defined in p.24 of the lecture notes, the no-arbitrage market price of the contingent claim at t is defined as the expectation operator under probability measure $Q_t-1$ of the the contingent claim. Since this process goes backward in time, we need n-t steps to get to time t.

Thus the no-arbitrage market price of the contingent claim at t is the the no-arbitrage market price of the claim using n-t steps instead of n steps.

'''
This function is the answer for Q1-d. It returns the array of all possible hedging strategies at time j. This is based on the definitions p.24 of the lectures notes.

To get the array we have to cycle through all the outcomes at time j.

This function is the answer for Q2-a. It returns the Black_Scholes price at time 0 of the European call option.

This is based on the Theorem 2.8 of p.26 of the lecture notes.
